#Scientific Caclulator
### SOEN-6011 course project


##### Project Description

➲ This is medium-sized scientific software engineering project for developing a calculator to calculate Beta function.

➲ Beta functions are a special type of function, which is also known as Euler integral of the first kind. It is usually expressed as B(x, y) where x and y are real numbers greater than 0. It is also a symmetric function, such as B(x, y) = B(y, x). In Mathematics, there is a term known as special functions. Some functions exist as solutions of integrals or differential equations.

➲ It has an injection of certain elements of agile methodologies. It includes a number of activities, resulting in a number of artifacts.

➲ It involves both individual work as well as communal work. The aspect identified by
means individual work and by means communal work.

➲ The work on the project has been organized into a number of constraints that you need to observe during the project, and problems for which you need to provide solutions.

➲ The project work includes proper technical writing in several places throughout the duration of the project.
